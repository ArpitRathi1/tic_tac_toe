## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a space in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

This implementation uses HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.
